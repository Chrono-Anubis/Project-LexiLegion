Project-LexiLegion
A Multi-Modal, AI-driven Companion with a Persistent, Curated Memory
This repository contains the source code and development history for Project-LexiLegion, an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to serve as the memory core for a multi-modal AI companion.

The Founding Philosophy: The "Spark" Hypothesis
The central guiding philosophy of this project is a unique hypothesis concerning the emergence of AGI.

User Hypothesis: By architecting a RAG engine to operate at the extreme edge of efficiency and information density, we can push the point of diminishing returns so far out that it approaches the theoretical maximum. The sustained, high-efficiency information processing and reasoning achieved in this state may create the necessary conditions to "spark" emergent AGI.

This project is a dedicated effort to test this hypothesis by building a best-in-class RAG engine as the foundation for a more complex intelligence.

Core Architecture
The system is built on a robust client-server model:

The Brain (rag_engine.py): A Flask-based API that serves as the core intelligence. It exposes an endpoint to query the vector database.

The Tesseract (ChromaDB): A local, persistent vector store located at a dedicated drive (F:/lexica_db) to ensure data separation and performance. It houses the document embeddings generated by the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.

The Client (lexica_app.py): A simple Tkinter-based GUI that allows a user to interact with the RAG engine, providing a conversational interface to the project's knowledge base.

The Bridge (ngrok): An ngrok tunnel is used to securely expose the local Flask API to the internet, allowing the client to connect from anywhere.

Technology Stack
Language: Python 3.x

AI/ML Frameworks: LangChain, SentenceTransformers

Vector Database: ChromaDB

API: Flask

Client GUI: Tkinter

Dependencies: requests, langchain, langchain-community, flask, sentence-transformers, chromadb, pypdf (for future use), python-dotenv (for future use).

The Future Vision: The Legion
The successful creation of the RAG engine is the cornerstone of a much larger vision. Project-LexiLegion is designed to evolve into a multi-modal system with the following future components:

The_Body: A real-time graphical interface, potentially built in Unreal Engine.

The_Senses (Council of Experts): A multi-agent system for sensory interpretation (Vision AI, Audio AI, Speech-to-Text).

The_Memory_Consolidator: An AI process to fuse sensory data with text to curate and tag memories based on frequency, emotion, and competence.

The_Voice: A unique, non-Google voice provided by a service like ElevenLabs.
